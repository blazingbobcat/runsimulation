# runsimulation
Version 1.0 of Runner Tracking Program

This is a simulation for a program that tracks a runner's route from their starting point and tells them to turn back based on their calorie count.

Copied from introduction text of program:

  This program tracks where a runner goes relative to their
  starting point (usually a house), and then suggests whether they should
  turn back based on their calorie count.  Their number of calories is
  entered upon start.  It will go down at a rate of 1/3 of their running
  speed.  The system will suggest if the runner should head back to their
  starting point if their calorie count is less than half the displacement
  they are at.  The program will not let the runner expend more energy than provided;
  A runner may nor may not expend all of their calories when they return to
  their starting point.  This program is not set to track any real runners yet,
  but offers a demonstration of tracking a virutal runner with a random number
  of calories to begin.  The time running is recorded and displayed along with
  the displacement and calorie count of the runner.
  
  Included is the source code for this program with all relevant header files from C standard library.
  It must be compiled for use.  The number of calories in this version is randomly generated
  along with the virutal runner's speed.  
  
  Feel free to modify the program as desired.  Feedback greatly appreciated!
